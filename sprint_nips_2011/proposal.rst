Scikit-learn: machine learning in Python
=========================================

Project usecases and benefits to the Python community
-----------------------------------------------------

**What**: The `scikit-learn` is a **BSD-licensed** project for machine
learning using Python and SciPy. Its goals are to find a good trade-off
between **ease of use** for non specialists, and **computational
performance**.

**Why**: In the modern data-intensive computing landscape, machine
learning algorithms undermine the decision and data mining strategies.
Python is increasingly used with big data, for instance by the web
industries. It shines in these settings because it is a general-purpose
language with e.g. a wealth of web frameworks or connectors to many data
sources such as relational databases. In parallel, Python enjoys a
growing success in the scientific computing communities. As a result, it
benefits from excellent numerical computing libraries. For these reasons,
the Python community has both the need and the tools for a easy-to-use
yet state-of-the-art machine learning library such as the `scikit-learn`.

**Ease of use**: The `scikit-learn` tries to bridge the gap between
academic research and general-purpose programming by being accessible to
non-specialists. This goal motivates the following choices:

- A strong focus on documentation and examples:
  http://scikit-learn.sf.net

- Ease of installation by keep the dependencies low (only numpy and
  scipy) and limiting the use of compiled code

- Simple API avoiding the use of machine-learning jargon

**Performance**: Computational performance is achieved by using recent
algorithmic results from machine learning academic research and careful
profiling-based optimization. The `scikit-learn` is consistently amongst
the best performing machine learning toolkits on mid-sized datasets [#]_

Community-driven development
-----------------------------

**Community**: The strength of the `scikit-learn` project has
been its community. As of Sept 2011, the project has had at least 52
different contributors total [#]_ and 20 contributors have made more than
10 commits during the 0.9 development period. Each new feature is
developed collaboratively using pull request and code review [#]_ . The
level if collaborative work in the project is, in our experience,
exceptional: feature additions are improve through a iterative effort
involving many contributors. The project is management on an
open-governance model: features are contributed without any explicit
soliciting.

**Contributors**: Contributors come from around the world. Historically, a
kernel of developers where located in France, but the project quickly out
grew these. A majority of developers are located in mostly Europe,
followed by North America, but we also receive strong contributions from
Asian and South America. Most of the developers are graduate students or
young academics, although some work in startups. In summer 2011, the
project benefited from a Google summer of code, which was hugely
successful.

**Sprints**: Up to Sept 2011, 9 sprints have been organized [#]_, mostly
located in Paris with remote contributors working over Internet. The
sprints open the door to integrating new contributors as they improve
communication and lower the barrier of entry to the project.
